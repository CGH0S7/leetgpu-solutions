# LeetGPU Solutions

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various GPU programming problems found on LeetGPU. The primary goal is to provide efficient and well-documented CUDA C++ solutions for common GPU computing tasks.

Each solution is designed to be clear and concise, focusing on demonstrating effective CUDA programming practices. Furthermore, every problem includes detailed explanations of the underlying CUDA concepts and techniques employed, serving as a valuable resource for learning and deepening your understanding of GPU programming.

## Repository Structure

Each problem has its own dedicated directory, named after the problem (e.g., `VectorAddition/`). Inside each problem directory, you will typically find the following files:

*   `challenge.txt`: The original problem description or challenge statement.
*   `solution.cu`: The CUDA C++ source code implementing the solution.
*   `explanation_en.md`: A detailed explanation of the CUDA concepts and implementation choices, written in English.
*   `explanation_cn.md`: A detailed explanation of the CUDA concepts and implementation choices, written in Chinese.
